# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
Tree Company attrition analysis

**1.	Business Understanding**

Through the following analysis, the business is looking to uncover various factors contributing to attrition across the company. This analysis is supposed to inform the development of an employee satisfaction program. Therefore, the analysis is meant to answer questions such as:
1. How many employees have left?
2. What percentage has the company lost?
3. Which age group produces the most attrition rates? Why?
4. Which departments experience the most attrition rates?
5. Why are employees leaving? (Engagement, Income, etc)
6. Does the number of years in the company contribute to employee attrition?
7. Does marital status impact employee turnover?

**Objectives:**

1. Identify how work-life balance, environment satisfaction, and job satisfaction drive attrition.
2. Determine which departments have the highest attrition rates to come up with tailored solutions.
3. Examine which demographics tend to leave the company (age, marital status)
4. Define how education level drives attrition rates across the company
5. Determine at what point employees exit the company.

**2.	Dashboard**

**3.	Findings**

**Attrition is highest among younger employees (18–36).**

These age groups show the largest turnover, with 166 as the total count. This suggests that early-career employees feel the weakest connection to the organization or face unmet expectations.

**Employees earning below 5K have the highest exits.**

The data shows that lower-income employees have the highest exits, with 163 of the 237 exits being employees earning 5K and below. The outcomes signal that the employees get discouraged from insufficient non-monetary support.

**Research & Development (R&D) has the highest attrition rates (133)**

133 exits out of the 237 come from the R&D department. Further analysis suggests that most employees (43) exited from low environmental satisfaction. There seems to be an even distribution of job satisfaction rates in the departments. More exits were experienced by employees experiencing high work-life balance, suggesting high triggers of attrition to be environmental dissatisfaction.

**Most employees leaving the company exit between 0–1 years at the company.**

The line chart shows departures peak early, particularly within the first year, and drop drastically after year 2. This signals a weak onboarding, weak early-development support, or unclear growth pathways.

**4. Recommendations**

**Strengthen the First 24 Months With a Clear Early-Career Pathway**

This directly targets the largest attrition spike happening within 0-1 years and young people between 18 - 36 years.
The company can introduce:
  A guided 90-day / 6-month / 1-year development roadmap
 	A mentorship match program
 	Role clarity and regular check-ins
 	Clear internal mobility paths
 	A strong onboarding process to attract aligned talents
  
**Improve Environment Satisfaction in R&D With Targeted Interventions**

Since R&D has the highest exits and environmental dissatisfaction, strategies to reduce attrition might include:
 	Reduce workload peaks through better planning
 	Introduce project rotation to reduce burnout
 	Train managers to improve communication and recognition
 	Establish monthly pulse surveys to identify stress points early
  
**Create a Development & Recognition Program for Lower-Income Employees**

For those earning below 5K (income bracket with the highest attrition), monetary incentives aren’t possible, so strengthen non-financial value by offering:
 Skills-certification programs
 Quarterly recognition for excellence
 Sponsored internal training
 Visible career paths tied to upskilling
